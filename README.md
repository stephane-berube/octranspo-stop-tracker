# OC Transpo GPS Bus Tracker

Using the [OC Transpo API](http://www.octranspo.com/index.php/developers) to
track the next buses' GPS location at my morning bus stop. This way, I can
spend the least amount of time waiting for the bus outside in the winter. I'm
also using the [navitia API](https://www.navitia.io/) to get the scheduled
times for the upcoming buses.

## Thanks
